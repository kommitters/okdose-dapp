[OKDOSE](https://okdose.co/) is a PWA (progressive web application) for world health. This application helps to calculate the necessary dose for the treatment of tropical diseases, this information is relevant to doctors, especially those working in remote areas without internet access.

OKDOSE-dApp is a project in which OKDOSE will be reformulated to become a decentralized application (dApp) that will be hosted on the [NEAR blockchain](https://near.org/).
